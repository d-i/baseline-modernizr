# Modernizr for Baseline

This is to add simple feature detection to a project. Currently we are only checking for `flexbox` (both current and legacy syntax) and `svg` support.
To install this via [Bower](http://bower.io) type the following command:

```sh
$ bower install git@github.com:d-i/baseline-modernizr.git --save
```
